# About Me

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m  Julius Kwame Ametsitsi , a Computer Science graduate diving into the world of web development. Right now, I'm focusing on learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) to build full-stack applications and expand my coding skills.

As an AI enthusiast , I am fascinated by the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning , especially in their applications within warfare , defense , and foreign policy . My long-term goal is to further my education in AI and explore its transformative impact on global security and technology.

Additionally, I have a strong interest in  financial systems and international relations , and I hope to leverage technology to address some of the worldâ€™s most pressing challenges.
